# Deep-vision-in-classification-tasks

Practical project in where different networks and pre-trained networks are used with the objective of classify images from a Kaggle dataset which contains vegetables. In this project are proposed 5 different models designed from scratch using CNNs and 3 pre-trained models to classify correctly the images. Different regularization techniques are used, such as weight regularization, data augmentation, as well as transfer learning and fine-tuning tasks.

I would like to give credit to my colleagues Javier Rodríguez Juárez and Álvaro Moya Sanz with whom I carried out the project.
